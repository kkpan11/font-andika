    <text lang="en">
      Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
      designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
      beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms
      that will not be easily confused with one another.
      
      A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
      people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some
      serif fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do
      with fonts that were available but not really suitable for beginning
      readers and writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to
      tediously cobble together letters from a variety of fonts in order to
      get the all of characters they need for their particular language
      project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. Andika
      addresses those issues.
      
      Four fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
      
      * Andika Regular
      * Andika Bold
      * Andika Italic
      * Andika Bold Italic
      
      
      Features
      --------
      
      Andika supports all of the smart font features that the Charis SIL
      font supports. It also contains features specific to Andika.
      These are:
      Capital Q alternate
      Lower case j serif alternate
      Capital j serif alternate
      Lower case q alternate
      No-tail t and y alternates
      Numeral 0 1 4 6 7 9 alternates
      Tail i and l alternates
      
      More detail on features can be seen at
      http://scripts.sil.org/SILUnicodeRF_Features.
      
      With the SIL TypeTuner utility (see http://scripts.sil.org/TypeTuner),
      you can select which alternates to use as Andika's default letterforms.
      
      
      A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
      ----------------------------------------------------
      
      The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Andika" and "SIL" in
      the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Andika.
      However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
      this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
      in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
      as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used,
      unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and
      "Andika" is not the resulting font family name.
      
      TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
      terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
      prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
      making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
      name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named
      "Andika Non-Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made
      with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Andika" or "SIL"
      Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like
      "Write Sans".
      
      
      ChangeLog
      ----------
      (This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)
      
      28 Feb 2021 (SIL NRSI team) Andika version 5.960 (beta2)
      *This is a beta version of the next major release.*
      *Please use it only for testing, not production, and give us your feedback.*
      *This major release includes spacing changes to some glyphs, so text in*
      *existing documents may reflow. However, the spacing changes are mostly*
      *for rare glyphs that most users are not likely to use. If you see*
      *significant differences in layout between version 5.000 and this*
      *version of the fonts please let us know.*
      
      - Added new weights (bold and bold italic) previously only available in the
      "Andika New Basic" fonts, although note that the new weights may not be
      identical in metrics or form to the Basic fonts, though care has been taken
      to minimize differences.
      
      - First (beta) release that uses a UFO-based design and production workflow
      All sources are in open formats
      Build toolkit and workflow is completely open-source
      See https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/en-US/Introduction.html

      - Numerous other fixes and improvements to various glyphs, including:

      version 5.000 is opened with version 5.960 or later installed. It will
      be necessary to find/replace the fonts in the document using the command
      in the Type menu. Please also look over the document carefully to note
      any places where changes in the fonts have affected letterforms or spacing.
      
      - Graphite has been removed. Application and OS support for OpenType has
      greatly improved, so the need for Graphite in this font family is greatly
      reduced. *If this affects you, and you find that OpenType does not provide
      sufficient support for your needs, please contact us right away.*
      
      - Known issues with this beta release
